    "content": "This Egyptian Household Characteristics report from the 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey summarizes key findings on household composition, resource access, and fertility.\n\n**Household Characteristics:**  The average household size is 4.1 members, with 13% headed by women.  Over one-third of household members are under an unspecified age.  Nearly all households have access to safe drinking water (mostly via household pipes), sanitation (improved, non-shared facilities in 90% of households), and electricity.\n\n**Possessions:**  Almost all households own a television (98%), mobile phone (90%), and refrigerator (97%).  Urban households are more likely to own a computer (nearly half) than rural households (23%).  Car/truck ownership is low (9%), while 8% own a scooter/motorcycle.  8% have a bank account. One in five rural households owns farmland.\n\n\n**Education:** Among married women aged 15-49, just under half completed secondary education or higher.  Literacy rates are high (approximately three-quarters) for women in this age group, particularly among younger women and urban residents.\n\n\n**Fertility:** The total fertility rate has increased after a period of decline.  Currently, the average Egyptian woman has 3.5 children.  Rural areas have higher fertility rates (3.8 children per woman) than urban areas (2.9).  Within rural areas, Upper Egypt has the highest rate (4.1). Fertility is also linked to wealth, with the richest households having the lowest fertility rate (2.8) and those in the middle having the highest (3.9).  Fertility rates are relatively consistent across education levels."
